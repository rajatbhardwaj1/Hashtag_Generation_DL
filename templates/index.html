                            Extracting keywords from texts has become a challenge for individuals and organizations as the information grows in complexity and size. There are many open source trained model such as KEYBERT, YAKE!, Rake, TextRank That can be used to extract keywords
                            from text. Our task is, given a peice of text, we have to generate the corresponding hashtags. Now hashtags are nothing but the important keyphrases which are related to that text. So I have chosen the YAKE model to generate
                            the hashtags. The only limitation that this model has that it provides only those keyphrases that occur in the text. I will be improving my model to generate the phrases which do not occur in the given text and are closely
                            related to that text.

                    remarks from the White House. "But my God — the fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don’t want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find it unconscionable.”

                    Nowadays, even the term ‘owner’ is changing. People prefer their pets as kids and to themselves as parents.This is how the relationship between pets is evolving. People treat them no less than humans. </div>
